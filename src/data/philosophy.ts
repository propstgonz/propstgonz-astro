export const philosophy = `Life is not about seeking comfort or certainty, but about embracing the chaos within and around us.
True strength arises when we confront our deepest fears and contradictions, transforming them into fuel for our growth.
In the struggle of becoming, we find our authentic selves—not in conformity, but in the bold creation of our own values.
To live fully is to say ‘yes’ to life’s challenges, to endure its suffering, and to rise beyond it, forging meaning where none existed before.`;
