    question: 'What is this site about?',
    answer: `This is my personal corner of the internet where I share updates, projects, and thoughts.
    
The original idea was <a href="https://www.baronette.es">baronette.es</a>, but I decided to make it more personal and more focused on my own (I'm a bit of a narcissist).`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Beyond all roles and memories, who am I at my core?',
    answer: `Hey, look buddy, I'm a technician, that means I solve problems. Not problems like "What is beauty", because that would fall within the purview of your conundrum of philosophy.
I solve practical problems, like "My printer isn't working" or "My [insert familiar] helped me build my computer, and it doesn't turn on".`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I contact you?',
    answer: `Absolutely! You can reach me via GitHub, Discord, or email. Check the contact section on the homepage.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I add you on Steam or Xbox?',
    answer: `No, fuck off weirdo.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'What are your upcoming projects?',
    answer: `I don't know yet, but I'll probably focus on studying back-end development, so my next projects might be related to back-end.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you accept contributions?',
    answer: `I appreciate interest, but most projects here are personal.`,
  },
  {
    question: 'You will update this site?',
    answer: `Who knows, maybe every two months or once a year — it’s just pure chance: a 0.25% probability each day.
            This site was recently migrated, so IDK. (tbh, I enjoyed the process.) 
            Just kidding — I actually want to update it, so I’ll try to add new things every week. (99% lying.)`,

  {
    question: 'Why the terminal look?',
    answer: `I love the terminal vibe. If you don't, well... tough luck!`,
  },
  {
    question: 'Do you know what my IP is?',
    answer: `Yeah, your ip is <span id="client-ip">loading...</span>. If you don't believe me, check it in
<a href="https://whatismyipaddress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline hover:text-[#D99058]">whatismyipaddress.com</a>,
so maybe later I will swat you, be careful with that.`,
