# THINGS TO DO

1. Refactor the ts code (Works fine, but I don't like how it looks rn).
2. Move counter.json to a proper database.
3. Fix the fucking clicker thing (I'm going crazy with that).
4. Rework the main page because the hub should’ve been finished (Should be?).
5. ~~Finish the hub page.~~
6. Add more social media links and their svg icons.
7. Maybe update the FAQ.
8. Update the computer section.
9. Remove main page stuff section.
10. Rework the page to look more a about me page than a merely portfolio.
11. ~~Add a contact section (store it in a database and send the messages to my email).~~
